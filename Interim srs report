Milestone and Deliverables
Here are the project milestones with estimated timeframes for each person:
 Identify problems faced by the client - (1 day)
 Specify buyer module requirements - (1 day)
 List expected benefits - (1 day)
 Manage testing and deployment - (2 days)
 Handle integration (JS, jQuery, Ajax) - (2 days)

Potential Risks and How they will be avoided?
Changing requirements risk can be avoided by following agile processes with regular client
interactions and reviews to align on scope and priorities.
 Integration challenges risk can be mitigated by researching complexities upfront, budgeting
time for troubleshooting, and leveraging integration tools and services.
 User adoption issues risk can be avoided by conducting training workshops, providing
ongoing support, and highlighting benefits.
 Data migration complications risk can be mitigated by assessing data quality beforehand,
cleansing data, validating mapping, and performing test migrations.
 Cybersecurity vulnerability risk can be avoided by implementing robust authentication, access
controls, encryption, vulnerability testing, and a cybersecurity incident response plan.
 Scope creep risk can be avoided by clearly defining requirements and scope in specifications
and following change control processes.
 Resource constraints risk can be mitigated by building in buffer time, identifying backup
resources, and closely monitoring capacity.
 Resource constraints risk can be mitigated by building in buffer time, identifying backup
resources, and closely monitoring capacity.
 Tight timeline risk can be mitigated by creating a detailed project plan with reasonable
buffers and periodically reviewing and adjusting the scope.
 Operational issues risk can be avoided by developing comprehensive procedures, providing
operator training, and starting support processes early.
